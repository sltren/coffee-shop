    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the frontend application:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

### Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Seed the database (optional):
    ```bash
    npm run seed
    ```

4. Start the backend application:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Running Tests

### Backend Tests

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Run all tests:
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

3. Run unit tests:
    ```bash
    npm run test:unit
    ```

4. Run integration tests:
    ```bash
    npm run test:integration
    ```

### Frontend E2E Tests

1. Ensure your backend application is running:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

2. Open Cypress test runner (both frontend and backend should be running):
    ```bash
    npm run cy:open
    ```

3. Run Cypress tests in headless mode (only backend should be running):
    ```bash
    npm run cy:run
    ```

4. Run Cypress tests with server start:
    ```bash
    npm run test:e2e
    ``` 

## CI/CD Pipeline  

Continuous Integration   
- **GitHub Actions**: Automate testing and building of the application on every push and pull request.
- **Jenkins**: Another option for automating builds and tests.   

Continuous Deployment
- **AWS CodePipeline**: Automate the deployment process to AWS services.
- **AWS CodeBuild**: Build and test your code with continuous scaling.
- **AWS CodeDeploy**: Automate code deployments to any instance, including Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers.  

## Cloud Services (AWS) 

To deploy your coffee shop application, the following AWS services are recommended:   

1. **Amazon EC2**: Host your application servers.
   - **Usage**: Deploy your frontend and backend applications on EC2 instances.

2. **Amazon RDS**: Manage your relational database.
   - **Usage**: Use RDS to host your production database, ensuring high availability and automated backups.

3. **Amazon S3**: Store static assets.
   - **Usage**: Store images, videos, and other static assets used by your application.

4. **Amazon CloudFront**: Content delivery network (CDN).
   - **Usage**: Distribute your static assets globally with low latency.

5. **Amazon Route 53**: Domain Name System (DNS) service.
   - **Usage**: Manage your domain names and route traffic to your application.

6. **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute service.
   - **Usage**: Handle background tasks, such as processing orders or sending notifications.

7. **Amazon API Gateway**: Create and manage APIs.
   - **Usage**: Expose your back-end services as APIs to be consumed by the front-end.

8. **AWS IAM**: Manage access to AWS services.
   - **Usage**: Define roles and permissions for your team and services.

9. **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging.
   - **Usage**: Monitor your application's performance and set up alerts for critical issues.

10. **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Simplify application deployment.
    - **Usage**: Deploy and manage your application without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

## Deployment Steps

Prerequisites   
- AWS account  
- AWS CLI installed and configured  
- Docker installed  

1. Set up EC2 instances for your front-end and back-end applications.  
2. Configure RDS for your production database.  
3. Upload static assets to S3 and configure CloudFront for global distribution.  
4. Set up Route 53 to manage your domain names.  
5. Create Lambda functions for background tasks and use API Gateway to expose them.   
6. Define IAM roles and permissions for your team and services.  
7. Monitor your application using CloudWatch and set up alerts.  
8. Deploy your application using Elastic Beanstalk for simplified management.  

## Dockerization 

Dockerization can be very useful when deploying applications to AWS, as it allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a container that can run consistently across different environments. AWS offers several services that work well with Docker, such as Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and others.  

### Docker Files 

Frontend     

Provide the Dockerfile for the frontend service.   

Backend    

Provide the Dockerfile for the backend service.   

### Docker Compose 

docker-compose.yml  

## Additional Notes

### Environment Variables

Use a `.env` file to manage your environment variables. This helps in keeping sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, and other configuration details secure and easily manageable.

Example `.env` file:
```env
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
API_KEY=your_api_key
```
### HTTPS Setup   

For a secure application, set up HTTPS. You can use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to manage SSL/TLS certificates for your AWS services.   

Steps to set up HTTPS:    

1. Request a certificate from ACM.    
2. Attach the certificate to your CloudFront distribution or load balancer.    
3. Update your application to use HTTPS URLs.   

### Security Best Practices 

Follow best practices for securing your application:

- Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.   
- Regularly update your dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.  
- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.  
- Use environment variables to manage sensitive information.   
- Regularly back up your database and monitor your application for any issues.  

### Monitoring and Logging

Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor your applicationâ€™s performance and set up alerts for critical issues. This helps in identifying and resolving issues quickly.  

### Scaling 

Use AWS Auto Scaling to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances in response to changes in demand. This ensures that your application can handle varying levels of traffic without manual intervention.  

## Conclusion 

This README provides a comprehensive guide to setting up and running your Coffee Shop application, both locally and in a real-life production environment using AWS services. Follow the instructions carefully to ensure a smooth setup and deployment process.
